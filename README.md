# Chemistry-Game
 
This is a chemistry game based game that I am currently working on. 

Current working features: 
* Liquid Simulation
* Solid wall placement - this block will be a physics devoid block for players to make hard barriers. 
* Water placement

Planned Updates in order of precedence:
* Updating container class for each cell to hold more than one thing. So things like oxygenated water can exist
* Cleaning up class names to enable easier expandability
* UI for switching between different placeable objects
* Save functionality
* More blocks and interaction between those blocks
* Multi-Threading

If you have any questions feel free to email me at ghgfhsh@gmail.com. This requires Unity 2020. Stable versions of releases will be published on a monthly basis.
